Breaking Changes

Support for Python 3.8 and 3.9 has been removed.
The format for GraphQL query filters has changed. Please see the GraphQL documentation for details and examples.
The deprecated device_role & device_role_id filters for devices have been removed. (Use role and role_id instead.)
The obsolete device_role field has been removed from the REST API serializer for devices. (Use role instead.)
The legacy reports functionality has been dropped. Reports will be automatically converted to custom scripts on upgrade.
The parent and parent_id filters for locations now return only immediate children of the specified location. (Use ancestor and ancestor_id to return all descendants.)
The object_type field on the CustomField model has been renamed to related_object_type.
The utilities.utils module has been removed and its resources reorganized into separate modules organized by function.
The obsolete NullableCharField class has been removed. (Use Django's stock CharField class with null=True instead.)
